# Yet Another SHA-2 Implementation

This repository contains a test implementation of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hashes. This includes the following:
- SHA-224
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512

Eventually, implementations for the following will also be provided:
- SHA-512/224
- SHA-512/256

Bear in mind: since this is a test implementation, there are no guarantees that this is a viable package for production systems. Consider this a reference for the algorithms, and use at your own risk.

DISCLAIMER: this implementation currently doesn't work. Still troubleshooting the digest.
